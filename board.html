<p>My goal is to improve the quality, appearance, and health of your skin! With all of the products on today&rsquo;s market, it is difficult to know which one <em>really</em>works. The harsh reality is that most of them don&rsquo;t, which is where I like to come in!</p>
<p>After graduating from Biola University with my Bachelor&rsquo;s in Business Administration with an emphasis in Marketing, I acquired my esthetician License from the State Board of Barber and Cosmetology of California. Both of these credentials, along with being raised in the beauty industry, have given me the proper tools to effectively grow my business.</p>
<p>Taking good care of your skin is just as important as taking care of your teeth. In order to maintain optimal health, you need to establish an effective routine. But going beyond that, you need product that will work effectively with your skin. My medical estheticians and myself have taken the guesswork out of &ldquo;what products&rdquo; work by testing the products for quality before allowing them on my site, and offering excellent and professional customer service to help you find the right products for <em>you</em>.</p>
